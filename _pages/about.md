I'm a second year undergraduate student from [WHU](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Synthesize data, model fusion, LLM.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liu Juhua](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/liujuhua1/zh_CN/index.htm) of sigma Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), WuHan University.
